title: "3D modeling of bridges for autonomous inspection with drones"
excerpt: "**Routine inspection with AI-powered UVAs/Drones** TFrequent inspection of civil structures, especially bridges, is essential for safety and operational efficiency, yet traditional methods remain costly and labor-intensive. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes an AI-empowered drone platform equipped with LiDAR, thermal, and hyperspectral sensors for comprehensive inspection. By leveraging 3D modeling to optimize flight paths and minimize collision risks, the system can identify both visible and invisible defects while pinpointing their exact locations. Ultimately, this integrated approach enhances inspection accuracy, reduces costs, and improves overall structural health monitoring. <br/>

1. **Routine bridge inspections are vital for assessing structural health, guiding maintenance, and ensuring overall infrastructure integrity. However, traditional methods can be time-consuming, expensive, and largely depend on manual, subjective evaluations—often missing hidden defects and posing safety risks. They also disrupt traffic, lack real-time data insights, and delay essential maintenance decisions. To address these challenges, this project seeks to expedite and streamline the inspection process by integrating autonomous drone-based techniques. Specifically, we propose:**
   1. **3D Bridge Modeling for Digital Twins**
      - Incorporate LiDAR into the drone platform to capture high-resolution 3D point clouds, creating an accurate digital twin of each bridge.
   2. **Multimodal Sensor Deployment**
      - Equip UAVs with various sensors—such as RGB, thermal, and hyperspectral—to detect both visible and early-stage, otherwise invisible, structural degradations.
   3. **Collision Avoidance and AI-Driven Flight Optimization**
      - Develop algorithms to prevent drone collisions during data collection.
      - Integrate an AI tool into the control system to leverage the 3D bridge models for designing optimal flight routes and enabling automated inspections.
