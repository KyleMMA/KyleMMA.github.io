title: "3D modeling for autonomous inspection with drones"
excerpt: "**Routine inspection with AI-powered UVAs/Drones** TFrequent inspection of civil structures, especially bridges, is essential for safety and operational efficiency, yet traditional methods remain costly and labor-intensive. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes an AI-empowered drone platform equipped with LiDAR, thermal, and hyperspectral sensors for comprehensive inspection. By leveraging 3D modeling to optimize flight paths and minimize collision risks, the system can identify both visible and invisible defects while pinpointing their exact locations. Ultimately, this integrated approach enhances inspection accuracy, reduces costs, and improves overall structural health monitoring. <br/>

The health condition of steel bridge girders is inspected and monitored using hyperspectral imaging (HSI), a cutting-edge technology that provides detailed **spatial and spectral data** for **condition assessment** of both chemical- ([corrosion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2023.130506), [coating degradation](https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings13061008), [concrete durability](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2024.135207)) and physical-relates defects ([cracks](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250106922Z/abstract), spalling) in bridges. HSI enables **early detection** of defects, such as scratches and rust stains, and evaluates the integrity and health of bridge components in response to environmental degradation and operational wear.

Through this innovative approach, I leverage advanced spectral analysis techniques, including **VNIR and SWIR spectroscopy**, to ensure reliable, **non-invasive** monitoring. This method empowers engineers with actionable insights for proactive maintenance, significantly enhancing the safety and durability of critical infrastructure.
