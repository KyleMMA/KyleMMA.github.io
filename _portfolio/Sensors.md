title: "Sensors"
excerpt: "**Sensors in structural health monitoring of concrete structures**  
Concrete structures are especially vulnerable to chemical attacks, which can severely undermine their strength and durability. **Chloride** infiltration, for instance, accelerates **corrosion** of steel reinforcement—leading to cracking and compromised load-bearing capacity if left unchecked. **Fiber optic sensors** provide a real-time, quantitative means to track corrosion progression, while spectroscopic analysis pinpoints chloride ingress early to identify high-risk zones. Additionally, alkali-silica reaction (ASR)—often termed **“concrete cancer”**—induces widespread microcracking and gradual strength loss. By leveraging hyperspectral sensors, ASR-affected areas become detectable at the incipient stage, enabling timely interventions that help preserve structural integrity.
