The health condition of steel bridge girders is inspected and monitored using hyperspectral imaging (HSI), a cutting-edge technology that provides detailed **spatial and spectral data** for **condition assessment** of both chemical- ([corrosion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2023.130506), [coating degradation](https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings13061008), [concrete durability](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2024.135207)) and physical-relates defects ([cracks](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250106922Z/abstract), spalling) in bridges. HSI enables **early detection** of defects, such as scratches and rust stains, and evaluates the integrity and health of bridge components in response to environmental degradation and operational wear.

Through this innovative approach, I leverage advanced spectral analysis techniques, including **VNIR and SWIR spectroscopy**, to ensure reliable, **non-invasive** monitoring. This method empowers engineers with actionable insights for proactive maintenance, significantly enhancing the safety and durability of critical infrastructure.<br/><img src='/images/10th bridge  inspection.png'>"
