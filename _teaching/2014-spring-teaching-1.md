As a full-time instructor for **_Structural Analysis_**, I taught over **100 undergraduate civil engineering students** across two semesters, from August 2023 to Spring 2024. This foundational course plays a critical role in civil engineering education, equipping students with the knowledge and skills necessary to evaluate and design safe, efficient, and resilient structures. 
Key topics covered included:  
- **Static Equilibrium**: Understanding forces and moments to ensure stability.  
- **Internal Forces and Deformation Analysis**: Calculating shear, bending moments, and axial forces.  
- **Structural Stability**: Evaluating the resilience and safety of structural systems.
<br/>My teaching responsibilities encompassed delivering engaging lectures, leading interactive problem-solving sessions, and mentoring students to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world applications. This experience not only honed my ability to convey complex engineering principles but also reinforced my passion for fostering the next generation of engineers.
