As a full-time instructor for **_Structural Analysis_**, I taught over **100** undergraduate civil engineering students across two semesters, from August 2023 to Spring 2024. This foundational course plays a critical role in civil engineering education, equipping students with the knowledge and skills necessary to evaluate and design safe, efficient, and resilient structures.
Key topics included static equilibrium, internal forces, deformation analysis, and structural stability, providing a strong theoretical and practical foundation to address real-world challenges in infrastructure design. My responsibilities encompassed delivering engaging and well-structured lectures, facilitating dynamic problem-solving sessions, and mentoring students to bridge the gap between theory and professional engineering practice. This experience reinforced my commitment to inspiring the next generation of engineers and fostering a deep understanding of structural analysis principles. My task as an instructor includes:<br/>
 <br/> 1.Taught over 100 students, developed comprehensive lectures, and conducted assessments. <br/>
  2.Developed and delivered comprehensive lectures and interactive class activities. <br/>
  3. Conducted course assessments to help students understand the material and stay on track.<br/>
