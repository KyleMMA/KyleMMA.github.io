The review highlights the potential of Long-Period Fiber Grating (LPFG) sensors in structural health monitoring (SHM) for reinforced concrete structures, focusing on their ability to measure strain, temperature, humidity, pH, chloride concentration, and corrosion. Known for their high sensitivity, compactness, and immunity to electromagnetic interference, LPFG sensors offer significant advantages over traditional monitoring methods. The paper discusses fabrication techniques, challenges like cross-sensitivity, and the need for advancements in materials and integration to improve real-time SHM applications, ensuring infrastructure safety and longevity.
