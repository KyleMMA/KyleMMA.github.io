Highlights: 

1. Hyperspectral imaging detects biochemical changes in plants caused by methane exposure before physical symptoms appear.

2. DNNs achieve high accuracy (98.2% after 3 weeks) in detecting methane-induced stress.
3. Methane stress altered spectral reflectance patterns, increasing visible (VIS) and decreasing near-infrared (NIR) reflectance.
