excerpt: '**_Keywords: Alkali-silica reaction (ASR); C-S-H; Spectroscopy analysis; Ordinary Portland cement (OPC); Expansion prediction; Nondestructive detection; Concrete durability_** <br/>The study explores the use of short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy to characterize alkali-silica reaction (ASR) products and calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) for nondestructive detection of ASR in concrete. It reveals distinct spectroscopic features for ASR products (dominant absorption at 5210 cm⁻¹) and C-S-H (significant bands at 5820 cm⁻¹ and 4370 cm⁻¹), enabling differentiation between the two.'

Highlights: 

1. **Novel Detection Method**: Introduces the use of short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy as a nondestructive tool to differentiate alkali-silica reaction (ASR) products from calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) in concrete.

2. **Distinct Spectroscopic Features**: Identifies specific absorption bands (e.g., 5210 cm⁻¹ for ASR products and 5820 cm⁻¹/4370 cm⁻¹ for C-S-H), enabling precise characterization of ASR and its progression.
3. **Correlation with ASR Expansion**: Demonstrates a strong relationship between SWIR spectral features and ASR-induced expansion, providing quantitative insights into concrete degradation.
4. **Advancement in Concrete Monitoring**: Offers a reliable, nondestructive technique for real-time monitoring of ASR in infrastructure, paving the way for improved maintenance and durability assessments.
