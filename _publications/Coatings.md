collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Coatings
excerpt: '**_Keywords: Bridge steel girder; nondestructive inspection; corrosion; coating degradation; spectroscopic analysis; hyperspectral imaging_** <br/>The study introduces a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique for evaluating the condition of protective coatings on steel bridge girders. Traditional visual inspections are often subjective and labor-intensive, lacking detailed information about the chemical integrity of coatings. In contrast, HSI provides both spatial and spectral data, enabling a comprehensive assessment of coating health.'

Highlights: 

1. **Innovative Detection Method**: Introduces hyperspectral imaging (HSI) as a cutting-edge, non-invasive tool for evaluating the condition of protective coatings on steel bridge girders.

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Demonstrates HSI’s ability to detect scratches, assess scratch depth using the Scratch Depth Indicator (SDI), and identify rust stains through unique spectral signatures.
3. **Chemical Integrity Insights**: Utilizes short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy to analyze the chemical degradation of topcoats, correlating decreased absorption at specific wavelengths with coating deterioration.
4. **Field Validation**: Successfully applies HSI to a steel bridge girder in real-world conditions, proving its effectiveness and reliability over traditional visual inspection methods.
5. **Practical Benefits**: Highlights HSI’s potential to streamline maintenance processes, reduce labor-intensive inspections, and enhance the durability and safety of steel infrastructure.
