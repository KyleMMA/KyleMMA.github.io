excerpt: '**_Keywords: remote sensing; hyperspectral imaging; vegetation stress; methane/natural gas; pipeline leakage detection; multivariate analysis; climate change_** <br/>The study explores using hyperspectral imaging to detect vegetation stress caused by underground natural gas leaks, achieving an average accuracy of 80% in identifying gas-stressed vegetation and up to 84.6% in distinguishing it from other stressors. By analyzing VNIR spectral data and employing multivariate analysis, the method shows promise as a non-invasive tool for early leak detection through vegetation health monitoring.'

Highlights: 

1. **Early Detection of Gas Leaks**: Hyperspectral imaging successfully identifies vegetation stress caused by underground natural gas leaks with an average accuracy of 80%, enabling early detection before visible damage occurs.

2. **Discrimination of Stressors**: The method effectively differentiates gas-induced stress from other stressors, such as salinity, heavy-metal contamination, and drought, achieving up to 84.6% accuracy.
3. **Optimized Analysis**: First-order derivative processing of VNIR spectra provides the highest accuracy for detecting gas leaks, demonstrating the effectiveness of advanced spectral analysis techniques.
4. **Non-Invasive Monitoring**: The study highlights hyperspectral imaging as a reliable, non-invasive approach for pipeline leak monitoring through vegetation health, offering environmental and operational benefits.
