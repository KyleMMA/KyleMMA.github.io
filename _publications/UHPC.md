permalink: /publication/UHPC
excerpt: '**_Keywords: Bridge steel girder; nondestructive inspection; corrosion; coating degradation; spectroscopic analysis; hyperspectral imaging_** <br/>The study investigates the effect of curing age and seasonal temperatures on the bi-surface shear behavior of high-early-strength ultra-high-performance concrete (HESUHPC) and normal-strength concrete (NSC) composites. The study underscores HESUHPC's suitability for accelerated bridge construction and structural repairs under various environmental conditions'

Highlights: 

1. **Mechanical Properties Development**: HESUHPC exhibits rapid early strength development, with mechanical properties reaching over 60% of their 28-day values within 3 days, even in winter conditions.

2. **Shear Bond Performance**: The HESUHPC-NSC interface shows superior shear capacity compared to NSC-NSC composites, attributed to HESUHPC's dense microstructure and low water-to-paste ratio, which improve bonding and transition zone strength.
3. **Seasonal Temperature Impact**: Early-age performance is significantly influenced by seasonal temperatures, with lower temperatures slowing strength development. However, this effect diminishes over time.
4. **Failure Modes**: Three distinct failure modes were identified, with most specimens showing NSC substrate debonding or pure shear failure, highlighting the interface's robustness.
