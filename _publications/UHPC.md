excerpt: '**_Keywords:  bi-surface shear test; HESUHPC-NSC composite; high-early-strength ultra-high-performance concrete; season temperatures; shear performance_** <br/>The study investigates the effect of curing age and seasonal temperatures on the bi-surface shear behavior of high-early-strength ultra-high-performance concrete (HESUHPC) and normal-strength concrete (NSC) composites. The results underscore HESUHPC.s suitability for accelerated bridge construction and structural repairs under various environmental conditions.'

Highlights: 

1. **Mechanical Properties Development**: HESUHPC exhibits rapid early strength development, with mechanical properties reaching over 60% of their 28-day values within 3 days, even in winter conditions.
2. **Shear Bond Performance**: The HESUHPC-NSC interface shows superior shear capacity compared to NSC-NSC composites, attributed to HESUHPC's dense microstructure and low water-to-paste ratio, which improve bonding and transition zone strength.
3. **Seasonal Temperature Impact**: Early-age performance is significantly influenced by seasonal temperatures, with lower temperatures slowing strength development. However, this effect diminishes over time.
4. **Failure Modes**: Three distinct failure modes were identified, with most specimens showing NSC substrate debonding or pure shear failure, highlighting the interface's robustness.
