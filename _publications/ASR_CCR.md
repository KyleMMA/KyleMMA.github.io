excerpt: '**_Keywords: Alkali-silica reaction; Sodium and potassium; Boosting and exposing; Raman spectroscopy; Expansion mechanism_** <br/>The study This study examines the impact of Na⁺ and K⁺ on alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in OPC mortar, revealing that Na-rich ASR gels cause greater expansion due to higher hydrophilicity and silica dissolution. It also highlights that external Na⁺ inhibits ASR in K-boosted systems, offering insights into ASR mitigation through detailed microstructural and compositional analyses.'

Highlights: 

1. **Effect of Alkali Cations**: Demonstrates that sodium (Na)-boosted mortar samples exhibit approximately three times more expansion compared to potassium (K)-boosted samples due to the higher hydrophilicity and silica dissolution ability of Na-rich ASR gels.

2. **Inhibitory Role of Na+**: Highlights a novel finding that external Na+ exposure inhibits ASR expansion in K-boosted samples, while external K+ does not have a similar inhibitory effect on Na-boosted samples.
3. **Microstructure Insights**: Employs advanced techniques (SEM, EDS, and Raman spectroscopy) to characterize ASR product morphology and atomic composition, linking these factors to the observed expansion behavior in OPC mortar samples..
